This game is inspired by the Choose Your Own Adventure series/genre of books, with the motif of a level 1 D&D character. Often surviving at a low level in table-top RPGs meant using your wits over brawn or resources.

The game is simple HTML. I use PHP here mainly to include common headers/footers for styling.
