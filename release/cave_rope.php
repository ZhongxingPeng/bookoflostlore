You fetch the <strong>Rope</strong> from your backpack. You try not to think about the cave as you tie and untie knots. Working with the rope has a calming effect; you feel like you're in control, for once this night.
</p>

<p>
That feeling of control does not last long. Your mind turns to morbid thoughts. All you can think about is death, and that you'll never make it out of this cave alive. You vividly imagine rope tightening around your neck. You subconsciously tie a hangman's noose before panicking and unraveling it. The shivering and cold continues as you sink deeper into your own mind.
</p>

<p>
You hear whispers as you fall asleep. You try to convince yourself that it's just a dream but the whispers are getting louder. The <em>Phantom</em> that haunts this cave is speaking maddening thoughts. The last thing you remember are feverish dreams of dying in Kingswall, over and over -- a terrifying nightmare from which you never wake.
