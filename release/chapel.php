The chapel is quiet compared to the Market Square. An old farmer rests on a wood bench and whispers a harvest prayer in the old tongue. A young acolyte lights candles in the alcoves.

<p>
In the back corner of the chapel is a bookshelf of religious works. You scan wistfully for a Book of Lost Lore but there isn't one. Another title looks familiar: <em>Bestiary of Unnatural Evils</em>, a seminal work of dungeon explorers.

<p>
You pick up the tome. By examining the spine you can tell which parts of the book are well-read. You open to a nearly-loose page of chapter VI, <em>Classifications</em>.

<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Undead</strong> describe the animated unliving, whether by necromancy or by some great curse. Many undead can be identified as living corpses -- missing flesh and exposed bone, pallor skin and rotting stench. Some undead have no physical form, instead haunting our world as roaming spirits. Such creatures manifest in subtle ways -- a feeling of dread, a too-cold room, or a sudden sadness.

<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Demons</strong> are evil beings from the realm of Hades. These creatures take many forms but often have grotesque deformities, scaly skin, and the smell of sulphur. They delight in torture and are drawn to fire. While many demons are chaotic and bloodthirsty, there are some Devils with acute intelligence. Beware such beings, who favor contests of skill and the fine-print of contracts.
</p>

<p>
Even the mightiest of dragonslayers has right to fear the evils of Undead and Demons. Normal weapons have little effect on creatures who cannot die. But beings of absolute darkness are frightened by the smallest flicker of light -- the warmth of human emotion. 
</p>

<p>
Protect yourself from evil with a memento -- any small item that brings you comfort or recalls happy memories. Cling to a child's blanket, a favorite toy, or a family ring and creatures of the dark will fear you.
</p>

<p>
As you close the book you ensure the <strong>Locket</strong> is still secure around your neck.
