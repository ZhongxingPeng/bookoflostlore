<p>
You find one cave deep enough to be safe for the night. There are no bones, nests, or any other indication that you're invading some creature's home.
</p>

<p>
You're tired. You unfasten your bedroll and lay it on the ground. The cave is strangely colder than it was outside. If you stay here you'll have to deal with it though -- lighting a fire won't be safe this far from town.
</p>

<p>
You take off your boots and lie down. Kingswall can't be far from here and there's no telling what horrible creatures lurk around nearby. You can only imagine what dangers are ahead. A sense of dread washes over you. You're shivering from the cold. You're going to have a hard time sleeping under these conditions. Maybe you can distract yourself until you fall asleep.
