<p>
You head back towards the road looking for safe shelter. It's almost too dark to see where you're going. As you're feeling your way around slowly you're startled by an unfamiliar sound.
</p>

<p>
You look down towards your chest; something is not right. As your hands trace up your tunic you feel it's soaked with warm blood.  The pain doesn't register for several moments. The source of the blood: a thick arrow with feather fletching.
</p>

<p>
You fall to your knees -- partially to hide from your attacker, but mostly because you can't feel your legs.
</p>

<p>
The moon is silhouetted by a half dozen short figures with glowing eyes. One of the figures begins to cackle. It can only be the Goblin you scared away earlier -- returned with a hunting party to see what you taste like.
