Greyrose is a free town tucked away in the shadows of the old kingdom. It's home to the artisans, makers, and merchants of the greater Rosewood Valley. It is a hub of commerce during harvest and a place of refuge during war.
</p>

<p>
Farming estates adorn the valley like patchwork. A peasant boy waves at you from across radish and cabbage fields. This side of the valley is guarded in relative safety -- there is always one watchtower within sight on a clear day. The tower just ahead is adorned with the colors of Greyrose: a pale green flag with a stylized crimson rosebud. This must be the last tower; you can see the city walls at the horizon.
</p>

<p>
Although Greyrose has a small population, it is -- necessarily -- built like a fortress. The rough stonework is not the same color throughout; the proud history of the town is evident in how many times the walls have been repaired.
</p>

<p>
Two guards face you as you approach the Main Gate. One points to a sign on the wall behind her: "All manner of weapons prohibited within city walls (citizens and guards exc.)". You cannot afford citizenship so you have few choices here.
