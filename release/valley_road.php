This road out of Greyrose leads towards Kingswall. Far different than the pleasant rolling farmlands of the previous road, this area slowly ascends to the rocky rim of the valley. The sunlight is beautiful here in the late afternoon. Wild flowers and interestly-shaped rocks adorn the pathway.
</p>

<p>
You see a figure ahead on the road: it's a lone <em>Goblin</em>. He hasn't spotted you yet. This gives you time to recall what you know about goblins.
</p>

<p>
Goblins are short, crude little humanoid creatures. They prefer to live in dark caves or under the canopy of thick forests, as their night-vision makes them dangerous night predators. Lone goblins spotted during the day are often scouts -- searching for food or whatever else Goblins are into.
</p>

<p>
When it's just one goblin they aren't much trouble. Really, goblins aren't completely savage. They have low intelligence but are often just acting out of curiosity or hunger. They aren't smart enough to understand empathy, and they can't be reasoned with. They are more dangerous in packs -- especially nighttime hunting parties.

The goblin starts moving. He's following his nose. Damn! He has caught wind of the rations in your backpack. Now he's seen you and is moving towards you cautiously. He's carrying a sharpened stick, the crude tool of a hunting goblin.
