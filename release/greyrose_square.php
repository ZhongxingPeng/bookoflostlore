You enter the heart of Greyrose - the Market Square. Several local farmers are selling early harvest vegetables. Two children bump into you as they chase each other to a nearby alley. A mutt is sniffing around for tasty scraps. Merchants are laughing, trading stories, and bragging about their wares.
</p>

<p>
The bustle of the market is soothing. You pause a moment to take it in. You know the dangers of the roads ahead -- it's good to meditate on life while you still hold it.
