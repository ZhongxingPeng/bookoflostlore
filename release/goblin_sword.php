You draw your <strong>Shortsword</strong> from it sheath in one fluid motion, ending with you dropped into combat stance and your blade pointed directly at the <em>Goblin</em>. You instinctively count the number of strides between you and the Goblin -- if the creature makes one wrong move you'll slice him in two.

 As you take a moment to process what just happened, you become acutely aware that it's going to be completely dark soon. You start moving quickly again, looking for a place to hide and rest.
</p>

<p>
 Luckily you see two options. Up ahead to the left of the road stands the ruins of an old guard tower. Right of the road, across a small grassy area, appears to be a small cave in the rock wall.
