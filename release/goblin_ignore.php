You decide the <em>Goblin</em> isn't worth your time. You continue walking on the valley road as if the creature is beneath you. It responds by moving off of the road.
</p>

<p>
A few moments later you hear the Goblin running at you. You raise your fists and spin around in time to catch a spear to the stomach.
</p>

<p>
The pain is intense; you have to fight to stay conscious. The goblin walks towards you and stares at you curiously. He's just discovered that humans leak the same red as Goblins. That doesn't seem very exciting to him. You pull your <strong>Shortsword</strong> out to swing it at him, but just the sound of steel-on-scabbard sends him running.
</p>

<p>
You collapse.
</p>

<p>
Some unknown time later you hear a muffled voice. Your mouth is dry. You try to sit up but the sharp pain puts you back down. Once your vision clears you see it is morning in the Valley. A watch guard kneeling beside you. Had he not found you, it is likely you would have bled to death. During the long, bumpy cart ride back to Greyrose you have plenty of time to convince yourself that farming is a noble profession after all.
