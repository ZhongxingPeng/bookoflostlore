The path that wraps behind Greyrose is barely a road; it's overgrown into unmarked wilderness. You know the general direction of Kingswall from here, which is directly through the foothills ahead. Navigating this rocky area will slow you down slighty but you press on.
</p>

<p>
Road weariness hits as the sun starts to set. Howls of wild animals in the distance remind you that you'll have to find a safe place for the night soon.
</p>

<p>
You keep hearing rustling sounds in nearby thickets of bushes. Hoping for a rabbit, you decide to sneak in that direction. Instead you're greeted with deep growls -- you're in something's territory. You catch the reflection of white-grey fur off some large beast. You start to run but it's too late. A pair of <em>Dire Wolves</em> has you surrounded!
</p>

<p>
You know that wolves inhabit this edge of the valley, but Dire Wolves are still a rare sight -- tall, thick, beastly wolves that can easily shred an unarmored man. The wolf ahead of you is salivating. This isn't just about territory, it's about hunger. The wolf behind you gets into a pounce stance. There is only a moment to react.
