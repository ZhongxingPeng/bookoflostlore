<p>
It is dawn of the second day of your journey. The mists give way to a cool, sunny Autumn morning. A variety of birds call to each other from leafbare trees. 
</p>

<p>
Already this venture has been challenging. But you're here -- alive and still heading towards your destination. And you have a bit of treasure in your pocket. That can't be all bad.
</p>

<p>
The road ahead will only get more dangerous. You'll have to stay keen if you want to continue your success. But right now, in this peaceful sunny morning, you are just thrilled to be finally doing this.
</p>

<p>
In the far distance you see your destination -- the sheer cliff face that contains the deadly dungeon Kingswall.
