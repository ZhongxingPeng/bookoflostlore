<em>Curiousities</em> is a small boutique of strange and exotic goods. The owner greets you as you walk in -- a rat-faced fellow with a patchy beard and scarred cheeks.
</p>

<p>
This shop is glorious. It has old swords, gemstones, finely carved wood trinkets, and books with suggestive titles. Rolled up tapestries fill one shelf, with a collection of fine paintings leaning against it. There are looking glasses, statuettes, and old jewelry. Some of these gadgets are so strange you can't even identify their use.
</p>

<p>
When the shopkeep tells you he's a retired adventurer it all makes more sense. Though he isn't very old, he's comfortably retired to a life of dealing in interesting goods.
</p>

<p>
As it is when meeting any adventurer, he regales you with grand (and slightly exaggerated) tales of his exploits. He and his dungeon-diving buddies had competitions on who could come up with the most devious use of plain <strong>Rope</strong>. The possibilites are endless -- setting intricate traps, springing other traps, climbing treacherous terrain, tying up a sleeping giant, swinging acrobatically across chasms. The shopkeep claims he knew someone that convinced an entire tribe of orcs that he was their god incarnate, using only a length of rope and some quick thinking.
</p>

<p>
You wish you could afford anything in the shop. Perhaps when, or if, you return from Kingswall you'll give him first choice of your findings.
