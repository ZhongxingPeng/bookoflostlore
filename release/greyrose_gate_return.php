You move to the back of the procession heading out of Greyrose. Thankfully it's moving quicker than you expect -- in three or four weeks, at the peak of Harvest season, it's going to be far worse. In a way you admire these farmers and vendors who are content to repeat the same tasks each day, sun up to sun down. That life just isn't for you.
