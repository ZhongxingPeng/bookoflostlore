After searching a few moments you find an exposed beam near the roof of the old tower. It only takes a few tries for you to throw your rope over it. You tie off the other end and fasten a harness around your waist. Climbing is strenuous after the day's walk but you manage to make it up without difficulty.
</p>

<p>
You remove the locking bar from the hatch and swing it upward. Soft moonlight floods the tower. You pull yourself up to the roof and survey the area.
</p>

<p>
Besides some vines and missing stones, the roof of the tower is relatively clear. The shape of the tower allows you to stay hidden from anyone at ground level. As long as the weather holds, this will be a good place to camp for the night.
</p>

<p>
You set up your bed roll and lie down for rest. Above you is nothing but a clear night sky -- countless dazzling stars watching over the valley.

You stir just before dawn. The tower is surrounded by a fine, cool mist. It's refreshing, at least for sleeping outdoors.
</p>

<p>
You pack up your bedroll and choose a bit of jerky and flat bread to eat. As the sun begins to peak over the horizon it reflects against an object in the corner of the tower roof. You wipe away some dirt to find a metal clasp. The workmanship is incredible. The symbol must be of some knight faction that occupied the valley during the old kingdom days. Some collector will pay a fine number of coins for it.
</p>

<p>
You can hardly believe your luck. Maybe you're cut out for this adventuring business after all.
