You grasp your <strong>Locket</strong> with both hands, opening it and snapping it shut. You remember the etching on the inside -- kind words spoken to you years ago. That phrase has become your mantra. It's how you find calm and motivation in life. You feel like you're in control, for once this night.
</p>

<p>
The silence of the cave is interrupted by an unearthly wail. You open your eyes and see a <em>Phantom</em> swirling above you! You sit up and push back against the cave wall, trying to control your fear.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly: light. Your Locket begins to glow, casting a soft candle-like warmth into the cave. You can see the full form of the Phantom now -- but in the light of your pendant it begins to dissipate. The ghost drifts out of the cave, unable to withstand the power of the memento.
</p>

<p>
The radiance of your Locket fades slowly. The cave is dark and quiet again, but is now full of a comforting warmth. You thank your training as you curl back into your bedroll. What follows is the best sleep you've had in weeks.

You wake just before dawn, as the glow of the rising sun begins to light up the cave. The chatter of birds fills the morning air as you stretch and begin gathering your equipment.
</p>

<p>
Something at the back of the cave catches your eye while you're putting boots on. You walk over and see a frayed piece of cloth, mostly buried in dust and pebbles. You prod at it with your sword before picking it up -- a small, crude pouch. You pour the contents out and, to your delight, hear jingling. The pouch contains six copper coins, two silver coins, and a small Amethyst gemstone. This cave must have been a great hiding place for someone bandit's treasure stash -- at least, before the Phantom frightened them away.
</p>

<p>
You can hardly believe your luck. Maybe you're cut out for this adventuring business after all.
