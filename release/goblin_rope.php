There's nothing to tie your <strong>Rope</strong> to here, so you fashion a quick lasso. Maybe you can capture and neutralize the little creature.
</p>

<p>
You throw your lasso at the <em>Goblin</em> but he swats it with his pointed stick. His reaction speed surprises you. This rope trick probably won't work on him.
</p>

<p>
You prepare to throw your rope again but the Goblin hisses and threatens you with his spear.
