One of the oldest establishments in Greyrose, the Flask and Wineskin Tavern is a cozy brewery and eatery. The smells of alcohol and smoked meats draw in tired workers and worn travelers.
</p>

<p>
Two traveling musicians sit in a lit corner of the tavern, plucking strange instruments.

You claim an empty seat and drop a copper coin on the bar. The Bartender pours you a tankard of dark ale. He nods at your scabbard and backpack. <q>Adventurer, are you?</q>
</p>

<p>
You nod and take the drink.
</p>

<p>
<q>Don't underestimate the Kingswall. Make sure you have a sharp weapon and know how to use it. The whole place is infested with all manner of Goblin and dire Wolf and giant Spider. They may look monstrous, but they bleed the same way we do. Just remember: every fight is just another chance to die. Don't go stabbing at some Orcish marauder or deathplague Wyvern and expect to get away alive. And don't go waving your sword at some ghost like a damned fool.</q>

The drunks at the back table have gotten louder as evening approaches. Now they're howling in your direction and laying coppers on the table. They're placing bets on how long until you die at Kingswall. One gruff local mocks you: <q>I doubt you'll even make it out of Greyrose in one piece!</q>
</p>

<p>
There is a round of hearty laughter.
