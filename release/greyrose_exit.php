It is late afternoon. The sun casts a warm amber glow over the stone battlements around the city. Most of the merchants have already packed their wares onto mules and carts. There is a long line of vendors jockeying to get out of the Main Gate and home for supper. Of course you don't have to wait; there is a back gate to the city that you can sneak through without drawing attention.
